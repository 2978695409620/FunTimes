Game
====

This is a text-based fighting game written in Java during my free time in grade 12.
This game features characters based on my classmates in grade 12 computer science class, with 
character abilities based on the person's traits.
This game is written using hsa Console since java was taught with hsa Console in high school.
The hsa Console library is included with the Java RTP program, which can be downloaded here: http://compsci.ca/holtsoft/
