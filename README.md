Game
====

This is a text-based fighting game written in Java while I was bored in grade 12
This game features characters based on my classmates in grade 12 computer science class, with 
character abilities based on the person's traits.
This game is written using hsa Console since java was taught with hsa Console in high school.
The hsa Console library comes with the Java ready to program, which can be downloaded here: http://compsci.ca/holtsoft/
